    "# Abstract \n",
    "Our goal is to find out the factors that influence movie ratings and use those factors to try to predict the performance of upcoming movies. The dataset we used contains various variables such as genre, release date, production companies and other related information about 45,000 movies released around the world. We will be performing two separate linear regressions once we have cleaned our dataset. In order to measure the performance of the movies, we have decided to use the following variables: revenue and vote average (audience score). "

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many factors that can influence how a movie is rated, like its budget, director, actors/actresses, its genre, and etc.. How these factors influence the movie ratings has been an area of interest for researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The budget of a movie is generally thought to be the main determinant of its rating. Higher budgets often lead to higher production quality, top-notch actors, and more extensive advertisements. These could potentially draw larger audiences and better reviews. A 2013 study by Eliashberg, Elberse, and Leenders found that higher budgets often leads to more promising film projects.<a name=\"Eliashberg\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#Eliashberg)\n",
    "\n",
    "People often anticipate movies by their favorite directors, and directors who've produced great movies in the past often receive higher ratings for their new works. Wallace, Seigerman, and Holbrook found that directors with previous successes are more likely to have higher box-office sales as well as better reviews.<a name=\"Wallace\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#Wallace)\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, genre is another big contributing factor to movie ratings. Some genres just seem to resonate more with audiences and critics. De Vany and Walls' study showed that action flicks and dramas usually get higher ratings than comedies or horror movies.<a name=\"De Vany\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#De) \n",
    "\t\n",
    "There are also many more factors that can alter the performance of a movie, such as the movie's casts, release date, and its marketing strategies. We will find out more about what factors influence movie ratings and predict the movie’s ratings based on those factors."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rapidly expanding world of film and television, discerning which movies are set to be hits or misses is a challenge for average audiences. Typically, we wait for critic reviews or box office results, but what if we could predict the outcome of a movie? Our goal is to try building a way of predicting a movie's success before it's even hit the screens. We will be creating a model that takes into account a range of information, such as budget, production company, genre and use these variables to predict a movie's success. All these factors can be represented by numbers, some variables can be represented by encoding them. The measurable aspect of this problem relates to the metrics used to determine a movie's success: its revenue and audience score (vote average). The model's performance can be measured by comparing the predicted success against the actual performance of the film’s post-release, which offers an objective method for evaluating our model's accuracy and reliability. The model we're building can be replicated for all movies. By using a large dataset of 45,000 movies from around the world, our model's learning and predictions can be reproduced and improved upon over time. To solve this problem, we'll experiment with multiple different machine learning models - specifically linear regression models. We'll compare them and pick the most accurate. The selected model would then be used to predict the performance of upcoming movies, providing audiences with a guide to potential movie success. "

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To predict a movie's success, we're focusing on two key indicators: revenue and audience score (also known as vote average). We propose employing the following machine learning models to accomplish this - Linear Regression and Logistic Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be performing two separate linear regressions. Since we're dealing with continuous target variables, which are revenue and vote average, linear Regression would be perfect for helping us understand the relationship between factors like budget, director, genre, and release date and our target variables. This model works by fitting a line through our data in a way that best predicts the performance of upcoming movies. We will also use regularization techniques (Lasso) to squish the least important parameters to zero to leave the most prevalent ones. To implement this, we will use the Scikit-learn library's Linear Regression model to fit the data. The model's performance will be evaluated using a loss function, with gradient descent employed to minimize this loss and optimize the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another solution is to perform a logistic regression which classifies a movie's success based on a certain threshold value for revenue and audience score. With Logistic Regression, we can measure how far a movie's predicted score is from a decision boundary and use that to determine the likelihood of its success. For instance, a decision boundary will be made if the vote average is above or below a rating of 7 and the farther a point is away from the decision boundary, the higher the probability the movie is successful/unsuccessful (depending on which side the point is on). We're planning on using the Scikit-learn library to implement our Logistic Regression model. We'll measure the model's performance using the soft log loss function and adjust the weights using gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may plan to exclude certain features, such as actors (since one-hot encoding would be too numerous) or overview (since movie plots are too unique to compare). Also, as mentioned earlier in the Data section, we will make sure missing values are handled with imputation, one-hot encode the according non-numerical features, and split the dataset with k-fold (value to be determined). With the remaining variables we can run the above mentioned methods with the Numpy, Scikit-learn libraries. A potential benchmark model is k-NN, and we can make two, one for predicting revenue and the other voter average. We can then compare these two with the corresponding linear and logistic regressions. Comparing our proposed models to this benchmark will help us assess the relative effectiveness of our chosen methods."

    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "One evaluation metric that we could use to quantify the performance of the linear regression model in predicting whether or not the movie will be successful or not is with mean squared error. This will measure how accurate our model is. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another possible metric, while less effective but still applicable, would be positive predictive value (PPV) or precision. Our project could be interpreted by predicting a binary result of successful/ not successful, however this metric is much simpler and provides much less insight. We could also make a ROC-AUC to evaluate how good our model is. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following metrics are not complex, and easily work with linear and logistic regression respectively. MSE is able to evaluate the prediction from a linear regression model, and the binary classification result from logistic regression can be evaluated with PPV.\n"
